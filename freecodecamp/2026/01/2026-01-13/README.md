## Instructions
Odd or Even?
Given a positive integer, return "Odd" if it's an odd number, and "Even" is it's even.

## My Thoughts

This was a very straightforward problem focused on recognizing a basic numeric property. Once I identified that the task was simply checking whether a number is divisible by 2, the solution became immediately clear.

I didn’t need to worry about edge cases or performance here—using the modulo operator directly communicates the intent of the code and keeps the logic concise. This felt like one of those problems where the simplest approach is also the best one.

## What I Learned
	•	The modulo operator (%) is the standard and most reliable way to determine whether a number is odd or even.
	•	Not every problem requires complex logic—sometimes clarity and simplicity are the real goals.
	•	Writing clean, readable one-liners can be both expressive and efficient.
	•	For basic checks like this, optimizing beyond O(1) isn’t meaningful—correctness and readability matter more.
	•	Small problems are still useful for reinforcing good habits and idiomatic code patterns.
